      "Kick-started and lead conceptualization and development of Hyperglance’s Web Client. This included selecting what technologies to use, defining a CI build, developing the Client’s architectural backbone, implementing a scalable SASS rule-structure, and outlining coding practices and standards. Moreover, oversaw all technical aspects regarding the Web Client and its integration with the Hyperglance server.",
      "Enhanced the Hyperglance JEE server-side feature-base, by developing core modules. The latter spanned the full server-side architectural stack, ranging from JAX-RS Rest Endpoints, and EJB enhanced business-logic features, to JPA persistence components. Additionally, implemented several real-time data gathering integrations between Hyperglance and external datasources (e.g., AWS, Openstack). This involved normalizing external data into Hyperglance’s topological and analytical data model.",
      "Other responsibilities included: interviewing both frontend and backend developer candidates, attending conferences, interacting with customers, mentoring new-hires."
