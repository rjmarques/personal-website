            Hi, I'm Ricardo Marques. I'm a professional nerd that works on both
            the back and front end, while using a modern tech stack to make
            things go: <i>Beep-Boop</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started off, as a Java developer, building JEE applications. From
            multithread solutions, to REST integrations and even JPA enabled
            EJBs. However, I've always had a big interest in all things Web
            related. So, when the opportunity to jump into Full Stack
            development presented itself I was over the moon, and as a result,
            these days I'm a full-blown Stack Developer. More recently, at a
            professional level, Iâ€™ve been working with Typescript on the backend
            side of things, and with React on the front-end bits -{" "}

              this website was built with both those technologies

            .
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time I dabble with tech I don't know much about. Recently
            it has been Go and Webassembly.
