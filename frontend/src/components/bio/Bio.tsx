            Hi, I'm Ricardo Marques. I'm a professional nerd that works on both
            the back and front end, while using a modern tech stack to make
            things go: <i>Beep-Boop</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started off my career as a backend Java developer, building JEE
            applications. Shortly after, my interest in all things Web related
            made me expand into becoming a Full Stack Developer. More recently
            Iâ€™ve been working with Golang on the backend side of things, and
            with React and Typescript on the front-end bits -{" "}

              this website is a SSR React App with a Typescript backend
            </a>
            .
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time I dabble with tech I'm less familiar with. Recently
            it has been self-hosting, IoT home automation, and Arduino.
