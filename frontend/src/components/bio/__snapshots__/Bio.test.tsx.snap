            Hi, I'm Ricardo Marques. I'm a professional nerd that works on both the back and front end, while using a modern tech stack to make things go: 
            <i>
              Beep-Boop
            </i>
            .
          </p>
          <p>
            I started off, as a Java developer, building JEE applications. From multithread solutions, to REST integrations and even JPA enabled EJBs. However, I've always had a big interest in all things Web related. So, when the opportunity to jump into Full Stack development presented itself I was over the moon, and as a result, these days I'm a full-blown Stack Developer. More recently, at a professional level, Iâ€™ve been working with Typescript on the backend side of things, and with React on the front-end bits -

            In my free time I dabble with tech I don't know much about. Recently it has been Go and Webassembly.
