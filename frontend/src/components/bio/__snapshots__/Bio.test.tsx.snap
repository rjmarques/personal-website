            Hi, I'm Ricardo Marques. I'm a professional nerd that works on both the back and front end, while using a modern tech stack to make things go: 
            <i>
              Beep-Boop
            </i>
            .
          </p>
          <p>
            I started off my career as a backend Java developer, building JEE applications. Shortly after, my interest in all things Web related made me expand into becoming a Full Stack Developer. More recently Iâ€™ve been working with Golang on the backend side of things, and with React and Typescript on the front-end bits -

          <p>
            In my free time I dabble with tech I'm less familiar with. Recently it has been self-hosting, IoT home automation, and Arduino.
